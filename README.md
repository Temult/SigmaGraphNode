# Sigma Graph Node for ComfyUI

A compact, bidirectional editor for sigma schedules in diffusion sampling.

- üìà Drag points on a graph to shape the schedule
- ‚úçÔ∏è Edit sigma values in text form (auto-synced)
- üîÅ Click ‚ñº to apply text changes to the graph
- üíæ Save/load custom curve presets

## Installation

1. Copy this folder to: `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/sigma_graph`
2. Restart ComfyUI
3. Look for **SigmaGraphNode** under **sampling ‚Üí custom**

## How to Use

1. Set your desired `steps`
2. Use the graph or text box to shape the sigma curve
3. Connect the output (`SIGMAS`) to a sampler that supports external schedules (e.g., KSampler)
4. (Optional) Use the üíæ button to toggle save mode and store/load your favorite curves
